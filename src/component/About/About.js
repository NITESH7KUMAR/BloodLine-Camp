            <h1>Blood Donation Camp</h1>
            <p>Welcome to Arogya BloodLine, a compassionate community dedicated 
               to saving lives through blood donation. Our mission is simple yet powerful: to ensure 
               that life-saving blood is available to those in need, whenever and wherever it's needed.
               We organize blood donation camps across various cities, bringing together donors, volunteers, 
               and healthcare professionals to make a difference. Whether you're a first-time donor or a 
               seasoned giver, your contribution can save lives and offer hope to patients in critical conditions.
